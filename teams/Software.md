## Shift priorities

See below for details:
 
  * Zendesk tickets (2 hours/week)
  * Zendesk backlog (~1 hour/week)
  * Github tagging (~20 min/week)
  * Github PR code reviews (~1 hr/week)
  * Github bugs (remaining time)
 
 Please provide a weekly report of actual times for each item above. Itemize bugs by Github issue number

### Zendesk tickets
 
   2 hours/week
   
   - **Handle tickets that you previously fielded** and are currently open. Try to get your open tickets to a closed or pending state (see "Managing Zendesk" below for more info on Zendesk statuses)
   - **Take on responsibility for new tickets** by replying to users in Zendesk, creating Github issues as appropriate. Tickets you field should be replied to as either _Pending_ or _Solved_
   
### Zendesk backlog
 
   1 hour/week (until we have no backlog)
   
   - **Work on backlog** by finding old tickets (>1 week old) that are not signed by a team member
   - **Take responsibility** for the old ticket and handle it as you would a new ticket, getting it into _Solved_ or _Pending_ status
   
### Github tagging
 
   20 minutes/week
   
   - Tag new public issues in priority projects by finding newly created issues that are not yet tagged. All issues should be tagged one of:
     * Bug
     * Enhancement
     * Question

### Github pull request code review
 
   1 hour/week
   
   - Review any PRs from other team members (see _Github bugs_ below). Comment with change requests or approval
   - Review PRs from public. Comment with change requests or approval. Upon approval, tag a staff member in your comment
   - Tagged staff members will merge PRs for now
   
### Github bugs
 
   Remaining hours (will reduce in near future)
   
   - Select a bug from the priority projects
   - Assign the bug to yourself
   - Submit a Pull Request for code review
     * Keep PRs short
     * Submit to an appropriate staff member and another student on the team
     * Larger bugs might take some work and more than one PR
     
     
## Managing Zendesk

Generally, try to clear out tickets within a week

When responding within Zendesk, sign responses with your name, initials, or some other indicator that lets us know internally who wrote the response

Ticket statuses are:

  * **New**: never looked at
  * **Open**: seen by a support person or has been responded to since last time it was seen
  * **Pending**: a support person has sent it back to the requester and is expecting an answer
  * **Solved**: support person deems the issue done, either because they sent a fairly clear final answer, or the requester had replied saying it is done

If a ticket requires code changes to be resolved, it should be turned into a github issue:

  * given new issues an appropriate flag (bug, enhancement, etc.)
  * the issue should refer to the Zendesk ticket number
  * reference the issue with a link in a response to the ticket requester for future tracking/reference
  * close the Zendesk ticket as solved
