## Managing Zendesk

Generally, try to clear out tickets within a week

When responding within Zendesk, sign responses with your name, initials, or some other indicator that lets us know internally who wrote the response

Ticket statuses are:
  * New: never looked at
  * Open: seen by a support person or has been responded to since last time it was seen
  * Pending: a support person has sent it back to the requester and is expecting an answer
  * Solved: support person deems the issue done, either because they sent a fairly clear final answer, or the requester had replied saying it is done

If a ticket requires code changes to be resolved, it should be turned into a github issue. And given an appropriate flag (bug, enhancement, etc.). Once the github issue is created, it can be referenced in a response to the ticket requester for future tracking/reference, and the Zendesk ticket can be closed (Solved)
