Keep your commit messages simple and succinct

 * Concise, frequent, descriptive comments as a rule
 * A single line no more than 50 characters

If you must have a longer message:

 * Separate the body from the subject with a blank line
 * Wrap body at 72 characters
 * Describe _what_ and _why_ vs. _how_

However, note that if you are needing to write long commit messages, you probably need to commit more often.
