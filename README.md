# How We Work
A collection of "how we work" resources, including our code style manuals


General resources go in the repository. Documentation goes, mostly, in the Wiki.

Please only put things here suitable for public consumption. The general focus is on tools, processes, techniques, procedures, and general resources that will be useful to those doing technical work with the lab or who might be able to learn from what we've learned.

## Getting Started with Knight Lab

### Slack
Slack is a group chat platform that the Knight Lab and thousands of other media and non-media organizations use for team communication. In short, Slack is where you go to talk to your teammates, Knight Lab faculty and staff included. Each project will have its own channel, where project-related discussion will take place. Other discussion you can take to DM, group DM, or a #random channel of your choosing. Pay special attention to #class-announcements, where... you guessed it, important class announcements will be posted. 

#### Pro tips: 
- **Fill out your profile.** Upload a photo that includes your face. Enter your preferred email. Throw in your cell in case your team needs to reach you urgently. 
- **Respect people's time.** Sometimes what you're talking about doesn't involve the whole team. If you and a teammate end up in a prolonged back-and-forth about Stranger Things, that's awesome. But move the discussion over to a DM so your teammates don't have to wade through it to find important content.
- **Install it on your phone.** The app is great. 
- **Can't remember to check Slack?** Set a reminder on your phone. Time to build a new habit.
- **Change your notifications.** You do not want to be emailed or pinged every time anyone says anything. Go to Preferences > Notification Settings > "Only direct messages and highlight words." 

### Trello
We'll be using Trello for project management—this means your team's deadlines, milestones, task assignments, and to-dos. Each team will have a Trello **board**, with lists of **milestones**. Each list houses a **card** stack—a collection of tasks that must come together to achieve any given milestone. So let's say a milestone for you is arriving to work on time. You might have cards for setting your alarm, getting dressed, brushing your teeth, etc. You can also **assign tasks and deadlines**—like if you need your roommate to make you coffee by 9am. When you're done with a task, you drag it to the "done" list. Cards are pretty powerful—you can comment on them, upload files, etc. This is how you'll **turn in deliverables and ping us to look at them**. 

### GitHub 
You will use GitHub for checking in iterations of your project. If you don't have an account, you'll need to create one and fill out your profile.
