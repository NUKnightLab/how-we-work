# tools-and-techniques
A collection of "how we work" resources, including our code style manuals


General resources go in the repository. Documentation, mostly in the Wiki.

Please only put things here suitable for public consumption. The general focus is on tools, processes, techniques, procedures, and general resources that will be useful to those doing technical work with the lab or who might be able to learn from what we've learned.
