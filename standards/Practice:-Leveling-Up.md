# Level-up your engineering/coding skillz

A few thoughts on the question "how do I take my coding/dev/engineering skills to the next level?"

## Pick your tools and learn them well

 * editor/IDE
 * how well do you know the databases (and respective query languages) that you code against?
 * build-tools
 * environment/dependency management
 * what is your stack? do you know how to deploy it into the real world?
 * documentation tools
 * Lint tools

## Read more code

Pick an open source project. Try to understand the basic internal structure and APIs.

Ideas:

 * compare the structures of 2 web frameworks. Are they both some MV[T/C]/Model II variant? How do they handle the full request-response cycle? 

Pick a specific functionality from an open source project. Try to understand the algorithms

Ideas:

 * Try to understand a specific machine-learning algorithm
 * look into how a specific ORM maps the object-model into relational queries
 * how does your favorite templating language work?


## Write more code

 * Contribute to an open source project
 * Contribute an add-on, package, module, plugin, etc. for an open-source project
 * Start your own open source project

### Write code that people will find and use

 * keep it in GitHub
 * write a package to submit to Django packages

## Learn about patterns

 * [The Gang-of-four Design Patterns book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns)
 * Addy Osmani's [Learning Javascript Design Patterns](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/)
 * [GRASP Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRASP_(object-oriented_design))

## Learn a new programming language

Consider learning a language that is fundamentally different from what you know

## "Right-of-passage" projects

These generally have numerous existing solutions in the real world. You probably won't write the next latest-and-greatest X, but you will learn a lot from the process

 * client/server application. Examples include a distributed database, or a chat app
 * web framework
 * templating library
 * ORM, or other query-formation library
 * code generator. Design a DSL or "little language" and build a code generator or simple compiler

## Learn unit-testing

It will change the way you approach coding even when you are not writing tests for the code

## Understand these concepts and dig into them

### Language Concepts

 * scope
 * control
 * data types/data structures
 * exception handling
 * variables/typing/type binding
 * pointers / references
 * imperative vs functional vs logical vs object-oriented language types
 * how well do you understand inheritance in your chosen language
 * the stack vs. the heap
 * various types of parameter passing
 * grammars and how they apply to programming languages

### Process / engineering concepts

 * what does it mean to be iterative & evolutionary
 * use cases
 * domain modeling / class responsibility
 * contract / encapsulation & cohesiveness / API
 * GRASP patterns
   - Creator
   - Controller
   - Pure Fabrication
   - Information Expert
   - High Cohesion
   - Indirection
   - Low Coupling
   - Polymorphism
   - Protected Variations
 * Design patterns (see Gamma et al, aka GoF)
 * TDD
 * Refactoring
 * vertical slices / "thin" slicing

## "Deliberate Practice" ideas and resources

 * coding competitions
 * Top-coder or similar
 * Kaggle

## Books on becoming a better programmer

 * The Pragmatic Programmer. Andrew Hunt & Dave Thomas. Sort of the "original" pragmatic book - from PragDave himself
 * The Passionate Programmer. Chad Fowler.
